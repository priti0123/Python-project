Build Your own Snapchat Using Python
Real-Time Face Detection and Overlay Application
This Python script utilizes OpenCV and cvzone to perform real-time face detection and overlay a specified image on the detected faces.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

Python (3.x recommended)
OpenCV (opencv-python package)
cvzone library
You can install cvzone using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install cvzone
Usage
Clone this repository or download the script (face_overlay.py).
Download the Haar Cascade classifier XML file for face detection (e.g., haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) from the OpenCV GitHub repository or use any other suitable face detection model.
Prepare the overlay image (e.g., star.png) that you want to overlay on the detected faces.
Update the script with the correct paths to the Haar Cascade classifier XML file and the overlay image.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python face_overlay.py
The script will open a window displaying the live video feed from your webcam with faces detected and the overlay image applied to them.
Key Features
Real-time face detection: The script captures video from the webcam and detects faces in real-time using a Haar Cascade classifier.
Face overlay: It overlays a specified image (e.g., a star) on each detected face in the video feed.
Adjustable parameters: You can adjust parameters such as the scale and position of the overlay image to suit your requirements.
